# Prisma Seed Script Error Log

This document logs an error encountered while running the `npx prisma db seed` command and the steps taken to resolve it.

## The Error

When running `npx prisma db seed`, the following error occurred:

```
$ npx prisma db seed
Environment variables loaded from .env
Running seed command `ts-node --compiler-options "{\"module\":\"CommonJS\"}" prisma/seed.ts` ...
C:\Users\ranaf\Documents\Full-Stack-Development\elitestore\node_modules\ts-node\src\index.ts:859
return new TSError(diagnosticText, diagnosticCodes, diagnostics);
^
TSError: ├втип Unable to compile TypeScript:
error TS5023: Unknown compiler option '0'.
error TS5023: Unknown compiler option '1'.
...
```

## Root Cause

The error was caused by how the Windows command line shell was parsing the inline `--compiler-options` JSON string in the `package.json` script. This is a common cross-platform issue with `ts-node` when complex options are passed as strings.

The problematic script in `package.json` was:
```json
"seed": "ts-node --compiler-options \"{\\\"module\\\":\\\"CommonJS\\\"}\" prisma/seed.ts"
```

## Resolution

The issue was resolved by creating a dedicated TypeScript configuration file for the seed script and updating the `package.json` to use it.

1.  **Created `prisma/tsconfig.seed.json`:**
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "../tsconfig.json",
      "compilerOptions": {
        "module": "CommonJS",
        "noEmit": false
      },
      "include": ["./seed.ts"]
    }
    ```

2.  **Updated `package.json`:**
    The `prisma.seed` script was changed to:
    ```json
    "seed": "ts-node --project prisma/tsconfig.seed.json prisma/seed.ts"
    ```

This approach avoids shell-specific quoting issues and provides a more robust way to configure `ts-node` for different environments.
